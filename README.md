Name:       Seungsoo Kim, Ph.D.

My work:  Bioinformatics for Aging research



## My bio

I am now a member of Functional Genomics Laboratory. I am trying to understand how living creatures aging and how to retard it. To understand the matters, I'm mining public bio-big-data. From 2007, I was trained for analyzing microarray data. My current research focus is on chronological aging process as well as longevity (e.g. Caloric Restriction) machanism in mice major tissues and yeast cells.

## My research interests are:

- Aging/Longevity of systems biology
- Meta-analysis using (epi)genomics data
- Age-related diseases and traits
- Evolutionary conserved features



## What I can do:

1. Transcriptome data analysis
2. Statistical association test
3. Pathway construction for signaling and metabolic
4. Using R, Python, and SQL
