# About me

Name:     Kim SS

My role:   Aging research using Bioinformatic tools



## My bio

I am now a member of Functional Genomics Laboratory. I want understand how living creatures aging and how retard it. To understand the matters, I'm trying to compile and mine bio-big-data. From 2007, I was trained for analyzing microarray data. My current research focus is on chronological aging process as well as longevity (e.g. Caloric Restriction) machanism in mice major tissues and yeast cells.

## My research interests are:

* Aging biology
* Meta-analysis using transcriptome data
* Molecular signaling networks
* Evolutionary conserved features



## What can I do:

1. Transcriptome data analysis
2. Statistical association test
3. Pathway construction for signaling and metabolic
4. Using R and Python
